# Diving simulator

A simple in-browser diving simulator with SVG graphics.  It attempts to recreate
some of the technical aspects of recreational diving.  Some of the things
modelled:

- Gas supply
- Diver metabolism
- Lung dynamics and dead air space
- Buoyancy of diver
- Buoyancy compensation device
- Buoyancy of full vs empty tank
- Equalization of ears
- Affect of environmental pressure on lungs, air consumption and tank gauge.

## Disclaimer

This is not a dive computer / planner.  The models are not accurate enough.  Do
not use this to plan dives!
